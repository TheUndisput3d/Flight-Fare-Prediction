# Fligh-Fare-Prediction

## Overview
The project involved the implementation of an integrative flight Price Prediction model, leveraging a dataset of about 11,000 samples with 11 features. After training a RandomForestRegressor model, created of a web application with Flask and deployed using Render.

## Project Details

- **Data-Cleaning**: Carried out comprehensive data cleaning using NumPy and Pandas, adhering to best practices by leveraging Pandas method chaining to ensure that the process is efficient, readable, and concise.

- **EDA**: Conducted in-depth analysis of different  kinds of categorical,  numerical and date-time variables by leveraging statistical measures, hypothesis tests, univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots

- **Feature Engineering and Model Training**: Applied advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques with scikit-learn, including pipelines and column transformers. Used learning curves to evaluate best-performing model among 3 models.
